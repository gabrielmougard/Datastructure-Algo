//linked list : unlike arrays Linked List are not stored at contiguous location
// the elements are linked using pointers

//why linked list ? - dynamic size compared to arrays
//                  - ease ofinsertion/deletion
// drawbacks : - random access is not allowed. we have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node
// so we cannot do binary search with linkedlist
//            - extra memory space is needed for a pointer is required with each element
